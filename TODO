* continuity

If we die for some reason (e.g. OOM killer), so do all the processes
we started.  This is not ideal.  Maybe create a separate process in C
that spawns stuff for us on command and talks to us on a named pipe or
similar.  We will need to arrange stdout/err in some way so that it
all continues to go through syslog (linux-specific solution:
SCM_RIGHTS; can we do something more portable with /dev/fd/n ?)

* documentation

As the interface stabilises, should write it down

* customisation

Perhaps there is a better way to generate emails than by embedding
text in the source code files.  ERB is the obvious go-to tool

* dsl

it might be nice to instance_eval the dsl code in a different context
than the monitor itself, as it's currently not at all obvious which
methods are for the dsl and which actually do stuff (e.g. log vs
syslog, start vs start_service)

* dsl/attributes

That weird '@attributes' thing is really not getting used much
